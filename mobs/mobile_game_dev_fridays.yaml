  ## What we do

  We are working on various mobile game related things, including but not limited to:

  - setting up local workstations with android and / or ios tooling.
  - designing artwork, animations, spritesheets, sound effects, etc.
  - Fine tuning game mechanics, strategy, balacing, and "funness".
