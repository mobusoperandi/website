1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and an `$ npm install`.

# Get help from the CLI

# Architecture

1. The website content is generated at build time, except for the calendars.
1. The calendars are generated at runtime, except for the contents of the calendar event element.

## Build time generated content

1. All content is generated by components.

1. A component is a type that implements `maud::Render`.

1. A component `Foo` and its implementations are in a module `crate::components::foo`.

1. The `crate::components` module re-exports all the components.

1. Components are never imported directly into scope.
   Instead, the `crate::components` module is brought into scope.
   A component `Foo` is referred to as `components::Foo`.

1. Component fields are `pub(crate)`. No constructor methods.
   An example of how a component is used:

   ```rust
   html! {
     (components::Foo {
       a: 1
     })
   }
   ```

1. Some types that implement `maud::Render` are not components.
   This is because they are used as HTML attribute values.
   The `maud::Render` trait is used for attribute values, as well.
